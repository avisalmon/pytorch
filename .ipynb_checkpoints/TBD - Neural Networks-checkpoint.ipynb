    "### Understanding Neural Networks as Linear Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, at their core, can be viewed as a series of **linear transformations** followed by **non-linear activations**. Understanding this fundamental principle allows us to use linear algebra and PyTorch to develop and train efficient models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear transformations in neural networks are often represented by **matrix multiplications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an input vector \\( x \\) and a weight matrix \\( W \\). The product of \\( W \\) and \\( x \\) results in a new vector \\( y \\), which can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = W \\times x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation changes the space and dimensions of the input data, which is a significant aspect of how neural networks operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a simple neural network layer, the operations performed can be broken down into:\n",
    "- \\( W \\) is the weight matrix associated with the layer.\n",
    "- \\( b \\) is the bias vector.\n",
    "- \\( x \\) is the input vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output \\( y \\) is computed by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = W \\times x + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation combines a **linear transformation** with the addition of the **bias term**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-linear Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of a non-linear activation function, such as **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit), transforms the output further to introduce non-linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a = \\text{ReLU}(y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ReLU** function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-linearity is crucial for neural networks because it allows them to learn complex patterns that go beyond simple linear mappings.\n"
