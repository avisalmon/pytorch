Build Neural network training

# What is it about? 
Welcome to our immersive PyTorch adventure! Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the thrilling world of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). We'll embark on a hands-on journey where you'll build ANNs from scratch and train them to classify images with remarkable accuracy. But that's not allâ€”ever wondered what's really happening under the hood of backpropagation? We'll demystify the math behind it, turning complex equations into understandable concepts. Along the way, you'll sharpen your data analysis skills and master training optimization parameters to fine-tune your models like a pro. And to top it off, we'll unleash the full potential of GPUs, accelerating your computations and taking your projects to the next level. So, gear up for a fun-filled learning experience where code meets creativity and every challenge leads to an aha moment!
